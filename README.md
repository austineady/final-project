# Wishbone - Final Project

### Wishbone is an application that allows users to find and store the products that they are interested in and keep track of what products their friends are interested in. 

## Project Requirements

- You may either do the project by yourself or with a partner. If you choose to work with a team, you must follow the Team Requirements as well.
- You must make regular commits each day (at least one commit per person per day).
- You must use either Ember.js or Backbone.js (or another MV* front end framework, if you'd like to learn another one).
- Your app must use at least one HTTP API, and may use multiple APIs.
- Your app must save data, not just pull it down (i.e. it must be a "CRUD" app).
- Your app must have user authentication and authorization, unless you receive written permission from the instructor.
- Your UI must be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile
- You must research your API to ensure it supports CORS or JSONP. If it doesn't, you'll need a server-side proxy. If a server-side proxy might be needed, you need to verify this immediately and let your instructor know.
- Your application must be deployed to GitHub Pages and the URL for the deployed site should be in your README, in your repo description, or both.

## Project Details

- Wishbone was made in Backbonejs using Best Buy's API (more information at https://developer.bestbuy.com)
- I used Parse for my back-end and both stored and pulled data from their servers.
- Other technologies include: Underscore, jQuery, jQuery UI, Polymer Paper elements, Masonry, SCSS, CSS, HTML, Javascript, Moment, Handlebars, Bourbon and Neat, and Font Awesome.
- I wanted to create an application that both challenged my knowledge of Backbone and also gave me room to add to the application as I learned more in Front-End. Wishbone let me learn more about and implement CRUD functionality, User Authentication and Authorization, developing an easy to use User Interface, and relations between different types of data such as the User and multiple products.
